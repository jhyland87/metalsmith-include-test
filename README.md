This is just a temporary repository to reproduce an issue I am having using metalsmith-include and metalsmith-layouts

### Summary
When you view the **[head.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhyland87/metalsmith-include-test/master/source/head.md)** file, you can see that it sets the `layout` value to **[head.pug](https://github.com/jhyland87/metalsmith-include-test/blob/master/templates/head.pug)**, and when the **head.md** file itself is processed (**not** as a *partial*), it gets rendered just fine, as you can tell from the **[head.html](https://github.com/jhyland87/metalsmith-include-test/blob/master/_build/head.html)** file in the *_build* directory.

The problem occurs when **head.md** is included inside another markdown file within the *source* directory (such as **[hello-world.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhyland87/metalsmith-include-test/master/source/hello-world.md)**). Inside **hello-world.md**, you can see that the **head.md** is included (and assigned to `head`), and then the `layout` is set to **[hello-world.pug](https://github.com/jhyland87/metalsmith-include-test/blob/master/templates/hello-world.pug)**, which outputs the content of `head.md` on [line 4](https://github.com/jhyland87/metalsmith-include-test/blob/master/templates/hello-world.pug#L4). However, when the **[hello-world.html](https://github.com/jhyland87/metalsmith-include-test/blob/master/_build/hello-world.html)** is generated, you'll notice that only the content of **head.md** is included, but none of the template data from **head.pug**.

### Updates
#### 12/01/16
After playing around with the order in which the metalsmith plugins *metalsmith-include* and *metalsmith-layouts* are executed, I noticed that if I put the `layouts()` call either before **or** after `include()`, the `head.pug` template will not get rendered at all. However, if I put the `layouts()` *both* before **and** after `include()`, then `head.md` is rendered using `head.pug` just fine... But then the `hello-world.pug` is included twice... I'm not sure what to make of this.
